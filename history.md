# FoxTabs Version History

## Version 1.2
*Released 10/26/2014*

FoxTabs 1.2 addresses the issues below. It is my hope this release resolves most of the lingering stability issues some have had.

- C0000005 fatal exception when using foxtabs
- FoxTabs 1.1 and Document View
- Foxtabs Issue with undockable windows

## Version 1.1
*Released 08/13/2011*

Addressed Issue: 

- Loading FoxTabs makes PEM Editor dock to it's sister utility Document TreeView

## Version 1.0
*Released 03/11/2011*

This is the first "stable" release of FoxTabs, and it addresses the following issues:

- Greg Green provided a patch that allows FoxTabs to survive a CLEAR DLLS called by another program. Thanks Greg!
- Fixed issue with Work Area Properties window.

## Version 1.0 RC
*Released 09/17/2010*

This is a release candidate for FoxTabs 1.0.

It corrects additional issues related to the following work item:

- FoxTabs - Incorrect variable name in an error message

## Version 0.9.2
*Released 04/10/2010*

The following issues were addressed:

- FoxTabs: Multiple Windows event bindings
- FoxTabs - Double-clicking closes tab
- FoxTabs 0.9 interacting with windows whose name starts with "Screen"

## Version 0.9.1
*Released 03/28/2009*

Minimized windows activated with a tab are now restored to normal size.

Also fixed this issue:

- Fox Tabs not opening table from Table MRU List

## Version 0.9
*Released 03/04/2009*

FoxTabs 0.9 adds a "Pause" feature that temporarily removes all window event bindings. This is useful if you are testing code and you don't want to risk interference from FoxTabs. Simply press the Pause button, then resume when testing is complete.

This version also addresses the following issues:

- FoxTabs - Make toolbar smaller in height
- FoxTabs - switching between windows
- FOXTABS: c5 error
- VFP program abort when using Foxtabs
- FoxTabs and SubClassLibs and C5s

I consider this version "feature complete" for a 1.0 release. I don't plan on adding any new features until after 1.0, though there may be more Beta releases to fix bugs.
